                        <p>The opposition is heavy. It is obvious that the demons will do whatever it takes to prevent her from going to earth. At times, she has her doubts, wondering if the physical realm is actually worth entering. Her guardian angel, Matthias, promises her that she has a great destiny on earth, even though she can't see it yet.</p>

                        <p>Before meeting Jaclyn, Matthias had been assigned to another soul in prebirth, a boy named Adrien. When Adrien was ruthlessly killed, the pain of seeing another child gone was too much for the angel. He had been overexposed to the evil, making him numb to it. He hates it when angels lose, but has begun to accept the reality of a fallen world.</p>

                        <p>All demons know their ultimate fate: eternal damnation in the Lake of Fire. It has been predestined and cannot change. Drained of all hope and joy, Saihttam's only purpose in life is to take it from others. Cunning, strategic, and menacing, he'll do whatever it takes to bring down as many souls as possible. </p>

She doesn't understand her husband's worries since there will always be worries in any situation, but she tries her best to calm his fears, reassuring him that everything will be alright. After all, he's not the one going through labor. </p>
