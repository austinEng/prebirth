                                    Josh Jackson is a motion graphics and VFX artist who lives in New Jersey. His passion for storytelling began at 7 years old, when he would obsessively draw comics featuring his own cartoon creations. His favorite childhood activity was creating epic adventures with his siblings using their stuffed animals.

                                <p>
                                    Having been homeschooled since Kindergarten, Josh had a lot of free time on his hands. That time was spent creating as many short videos as possible, mostly involving martial arts and special effects. At age 13, he created a short film series <i>Ultrakids</i>, premiering a new movie every year featuring his friends from church.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With every Ultrakids movie, his scripts and visual effects became more elaborate. Everything changed with the sixth and final Ultrakids movie that he shot and edited with Brian Tang in 2012. He had worked with Brian before on smaller projects, doing visual effects shots for Brian's youtube channel StopMotionClub. By now, both of them felt they were ready to shoot a high-quality, spectacular short film, one that would define them along with Matthew Przywara as a filmmaking team.

                                    Josh is currently working part-time as an editor for Trendsetter Media and Marketing, where he's worked on motion graphics for artists such as Alex Aiono and the Cataracs. He's also spent the past couple years writing a young adult novel The Mansion, which he hopes to release soon. Josh also enjoys teaching, playing guitar, and gorging himself with rice pudding.

                                    Left Hand and Right Hand were the stars of Brian's earliest stories. Yes...they were played by his left hand and right hand; primitive, but effective in showing his imagination to others. Around middle school, he upgraded his storytelling equipment from hands to a camera where he did his storytelling through stop-motion animation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To share this interest in high school, Brian founded the StopMotionClub in his freshman year. After a few months, the word "Club" was the only valid word in the name. Not many of the members shared the patience stop-motion animation required, so the club moved into the world of film and video.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Brian eventually expanded from being a school club into an independent film production group. He and a group of homeschoolers who share the same passion in filming and went on to make numerous short films varying in scope, size, length, messages, and visual effects. Not long after, Brian created the viral video "Temple Run the Movie trailer" which garnered over one million views. As a result, Brian received several job opportunities including directing an official music video for Asian rapper MC Jin. His Youtube journey eventually ended with Brian attending the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California, where he excels in his gift of cinematography, directing, and editing. Brian intends to continue making films wherever God grants him the opportunities.

                                    Faith Liu has participated in the human act of storytelling ever since she got smart enough to invent the rudimentary lie "it wasn't me!" Since then, her lies and life have become far more complex and, thankfully, less malignant (although no less devious). Since meeting Brian and discovering Celtx scriptwriting software, she has worked in many aspects of filmmaking - drafting dialogue, managing money, playing PR, etc., although her most prevalent role is "mom."
                                </p>

                                    As in her previous work as producer for Stopmotionclub, Faith worked in coordinating Prebirth's time, money, people, and props, essentially attempting to make the shooting time frame and Josh's budget stretch as far as they would go. Although her favourite job was managing the prop guns table, her job could be better described as a balloon salesman, trying to allow the balloons all their floating glory, without letting them fly away altogether  to pop at high altitudes instead of be given to happy children. Josh and Brian were the balloons.

                                    Faith is currently studying English, music, and theatre at Hillsdale College, reading psychology essays on horror and the "weird fiction" of Lovecraft, Hawthorne, and Kirk, and circuiting fresnels and ellipsoidals on the theatre catwalks. One day, these will translate into marketable skills. She hopes.

His true parents were from planet Urk, in a galaxy several gazillion light years away, where everyone is ten times smarter than people on Earth. Since discovering his heritage, he used his incredible intelligence to create his own filmmaking rigs and equipment, code his own websites, and direct and shoot his own short films. He currently attends High Tech High, one of the top high schools in the nation.

                                    Marcus Cheung is currently a junior attending Holmdel High School. His passion for the creation of media started with his love for photography, as he purchased his first DSLR when he was in 8th grade.

                                <p>
                                    However, it was only later in the year when Marcus decided to make a video about ways to save the environment as an english project.
                                    His love for filmmaking was sparked then, and has only grown since. His first major work was Escapes, made with a friend that was a timelapse video of different aspects of nature.
                                    Soon, he got himself into Holmdel High School's Lip Dub board and has now earned the position of Director for HHS's 2014 Lip Dub.

                                    Before the making of this film, Marcus had no idea who Josh Jackson and Brian Tang were. However, he had heard of Stopmotionclub through a friend and was seriously impressed by their making of the Temple Run: The Movie trailer.
                                    Coincidentally, he had jokingly posted on the group's Facebook page asking if he could intern in the summer, and two years later, his dreams came true.

                                    Justin Tang is a junior attending Freehold Township High School in an International Studies learning program.  As the younger cousin of both Brian Tang and Austin Eng, Justin's love for film stemmed from a mutual interest in Star Wars, as indicated by his massive Star Wars Lego collection.  He later got into stop-motion animation along with his cousins, producing several very amateur Lego stop-motion films himself.

                                    However, Justin decided to move onto bigger and better things and joined Brian Tang and Stopmotionclub in the creation of the viral video hit Temple Run the Movie Trailer.  Known as the "behind the scenes guy" and the "do-everything-else-that-needs-to-be-done guy," (which includes acting on the fly and holding up camera rigs and water bottles) Justin was always recording precious BTS footage just in case a blooper slipped and nobody was there to catch it, all while filling in any other role that was necessary.  He again joined Brian and Josh in the making of Prebirth: The Eternal War.

                                    Currently, Justin is working as a computer repair technician and hones his acting skill on his school's National Forensics League team. He enjoys rooting for the New York Knicks, playing basketball, practicing photography, and constructing Lego sets. His current passion lies in the intense free-to-play online mecha shooter <i>Hawken</i>, where he aspires to become the world's best Grenadier pilot.
