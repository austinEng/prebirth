                                    Josh likes to sing. He sings so much that his life is practically a musical.  Originally, he had Prebirth planned out as a musical with hit songs such as "There Is A Demon In My Stomach" and "My Baby Is Dead."

                                    In 2011,  Josh thought of a cool movie idea that he called his "untitled prebirth film." He spent a long time trying to think of a good title. Five minutes later, he gave up and called it Prebirth. He later wrote the script on sticky notes during lunch breaks at his job.

                                    Josh is currently working at Trendsetter Media and Marketing, creating content for clients such as the Cataracs, Snoop Lion, Cimorelli, and Alex Aiono. He also has a young adult novel "The Mansion" coming out later this year.

                                    When he was in high school, Brian created the viral video, "Temple Run: The Movie Trailer." It was a huge success with over a million views. Unfortunately, it was attached to his youtube channel StopMotionClub, causing people to think he wanted to be the next Henry Selick when he actually wanted to be more like Robin Thicke.
                                    As a result of his viral video, he was offered several job opportunities including directing an official music video for international star MC Jin. He is now attending the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California, where he continues to excel in his gift of cinematography, directing, and editing.

                                    Faith Liu has participated in the human act of storytelling ever since she got smart enough to invent the rudimentary lie "it wasn't me!" Since then, her lies and life have become far more complex and, thankfully, less malignant (although no less devious). Since meeting Brian and discovering Celtx scriptwriting software, she has worked in many aspects of filmmaking - drafting dialogue, managing money, playing PR, etc., although her most prevalent role is "mom."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As in her previous work as producer for Stopmotionclub, Faith worked in coordinating Prebirth's time, money, people, and props, essentially attempting to make the shooting time frame and Josh's budget stretch as far as they would go. Although her favourite job was managing the prop guns table, her job could be better described as a balloon salesman, trying to allow the balloons all their floating glory, without letting them fly away altogether  to pop at high altitudes instead of be given to happy children. Josh and Brian were the balloons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Faith is currently studying English, music, and theatre at Hillsdale College, reading psychology essays on horror and the "weird fiction" of Lovecraft, Hawthorne, and Kirk, and circuiting fresnels and ellipsoidals on the theatre catwalks. One day, these will translate into marketable skills. She hopes.

His true parents were from planet Urk, in a galaxy several gazillion light years away, where everyone is ten times smarter than people on Earth. Since discovering his heritage, he used his incredible intelligence to create his own filmmaking rigs and equipment, code his own websites, and direct and shoot his own short films. He currently attends High Tech High, one of the top high schools in the nation.
